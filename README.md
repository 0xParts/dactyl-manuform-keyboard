## Design generation
- Run `lein repl`
- Run this command `(def thumb-style "default")(def nrows 5)(def ncols 6)(load-file "src/dactyl.clj")`
- This will regenerate the `things/` files
- Use OpenSCAD to open the `.scad` files to view and/or export `.stl` files
- Alternatively use the `./run-generator.sh` script to generate all the designs
- Then you can use `./stl-export.sh` to generate all the `.stl` files
